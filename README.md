Sublime Text 2 Plugin

PHP ONLY
========

PHP Method Grabber

Notes and Issues:
==================
	Working on a way to only have to press the period one time. 
	For some reason if you only press it one time the event is ran before the list is built.


Usage:
======
Pressing ".." after object opens ST2's autocomplete.

Features
========

For us programmers that are die hard dot syntax guys and don't like having to type the arrow.(I know we are lazy, but I am a creature of habit.)

The ".." is replaced with the "->" symbol.

Upon the second press of the period Sublime's autocomplete is opened containing only the methods that are associated with that object.

If this doesn't work check your include paths.  Make sure your class file has been saved.


Upcoming features: 
==================

For you die hard guys that just have to type the "->" to access your object methods there will shortly be functionality for that as well.

Access to parent/base class methods.
